## Notes

* The syllabus is highly motivated from one of the best resources around:   
    * Introductiont o Algorithms (Third Edition) - Thomas H. Cormen et al
    * Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (Wiley publications) - Goodrich et al
* Lots of questions will be discussed as we move along, the target is to be good in problem solving.
* Every time we go, we'll discuss use of a data structure or an algorithm in an open-source project.

## Do you want to collaborate?

This is going to be a huge series, and I'll appreciate if someone wants to collaborate in this. If you are curious, here is how you can collaborate:

1. Join the discord channel: https://discord.gg/AMByfmS4NC.
2. Follow the latest updates, and join us on the live streams.
3. If you have a better solution to a problem we discussed before, let us know!
4. If you want to come on the stream and talk about a topic, please share your profile with the admin team on discord, and I'll be more than happy to consider you for a guest session.
5. If you want me to show-case your project on how you used a particular data structure or algorithm, you are most welcome to reach out to us.
